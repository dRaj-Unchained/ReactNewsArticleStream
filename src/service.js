                   <p><em>The Bank of England </em> has revised downwards its estimate of future COVID-19-connected losses for U.K. banks, saying their capital buffers are robust enough to allow them to keep lending to the real economy.</p>
        
                <p>Despite British lenders reporting an additional £18 billion of credit losses on outstanding loans in the first half of 2020, the BoE revised its future aggregate loss estimate to "somewhat less than £80 billion" on the back of more-benign GDP predictions from its monetary policy committee.</p>
                <p>Banks have set aside billions for expected losses as a result of the pandemic, with some increasing provisions in the second quarter.</p>

                   <p>
                   <em>Lloyds Banking Group PLC</em> swung to a first-half loss after setting aside a larger-than-expected £2.4 billion second-quarter loan loss provision — much higher than the first-quarter provision of £1.4 billion. It estimated that the impact of the pandemic lockdown was more significant than previously forecast.</p>
        
                <p>HSBC Holdings PLC, for instance, increased its scope for full-year expected credit losses to between $8 billion and $13 billion, up from between $7 billion and $11 billion, which it had predicted in April.</p>

                <p>NatWest Group Plc, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, set aside an extra £2 billion to cover an expected rise in losses, after initially setting aside £802 million to deal with the crisis in May.</p>

                <p>Barclays, which has substantial unsecured borrowing through its credit card business, has the most set aside, with expected credit losses as a percentage of its loan book totaling 2.46%. Standard Chartered has set aside 2.30%, NatWest 1.72%, Lloyds 1.4%, and HSBC 1.33%.</p>

                  <h3 id="introduction">BoE's</h3>
        
                   <p><em> The BoE's </em>latest Financial Stability Report, published Aug. 6, bases its predictions on the more optimistic projections published in the accompanying monetary policy committee report.</p>
        
                <p>The MPC, which voted unanimously to maintain interest rates at 0.1%, took a more optimistic view of the U.K. economy than it had previously. It now expects a 9.5% decline in U.K. economic output in 2020 compared with a fall of 14% predicted in its May report.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
                   <p><em>In May</em> , under the MPC's economic scenario, the BoE was expecting banks to see credit losses of just over £80 billion. The central bank notes that in the first half of 2020 banks have reported an additional £18 million of credit losses on outstanding loans.</p>
                   <p>But the financial policy committee said the latest, more benign, projection from the MPC regarding the effects of the pandemic on the economy would lessen banks' credit losses and that banks were well-equipped to cope.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
                   <p>"The FPC judges that the MPC's central projection would be consistent with credit losses of less than £80 billion and therefore continues to judge that banks' capital buffers are more than sufficient to absorb the losses that are likely to arise," it said.</p>
                   <p>"Taking into account the government's lending guarantee schemes, banks have the capacity to continue to provide credit to support the U.K. economy."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
                   <p>The BoE said that, since the start of the pandemic, businesses have raised more than £70 billion of net additional financing from banks ― primarily through government-backed loan guarantee schemes ― and through access to financial markets.</p>
                   <p>Despite the relative optimism, the BoE acknowledges that the banking system cannot be resilient in all circumstances, noting that there are inevitably very severe economic outcomes that would challenge the banks' ability to lend.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
                   <p>But it emphasizes, as the BoE has from the start of the crisis, that continuing to lend is key to the most beneficial outcome for the economy and for banks.</p>
                   <p>"There are costs to banks taking defensive actions, such as cutting lending, in order to try to widen the range of possible outcomes to which they would be resilient. By restricting lending, those actions could make the central outlook materially worse," said the report.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
                   <p>The FPC focused on the capital buffers built up by banks to cope with unexpected stress and said the buffers are there to be used to allow banks to continue to lend. Indeed, it warns that reducing lending — a "defensive action" as it calls it — may be necessary but only if the economic situation is so dire that it jeopardizes banks' resilience and ability to absorb losses.</p>
                   <p>The FPC also carried out a "reverse stress test" to analyse how much worse the economic situation would have to be in order to deplete banks' regulatory capital buffers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
                   <p>It estimated that to reduce capital ratios by around 5 percentage points, banks would need to incur credit impairments of around £120 billion. To reach that level of impairment there would have to be a very slow recovery from the 2020 first half economic shock and a double-dip recession later in the year. Indeed, the cumulative loss of economic output would have to be around twice as large as the MPC's central projection, with unemployment reaching about 15%, for instance.</p>
                   <p>The BoE estimates that the £120 billion of losses in the "reverse stress test" would deplete around 60% of the buffers of capital which sit above banks' minimum requirements. Banks could absorb a further £80 billion of losses arising from further shocks on top of that.</p>

             <p>U.S. bankruptcies are on pace to hit their worst levels in 10 years, with experts expecting even more companies to suffer as the coronavirus pandemic stifles economic activity.</p>
  
          <p>A total of 424 companies have gone bankrupt this year as of Aug. 9. This exceeds the number of filings during any comparable period since 2010 as the U.S. economy contracts and the coronavirus takes its toll on numerous industries, especially those relying on consumer spending.

          </p>

             <p>comp place Market data's bankruptcy analysis includes public companies or private companies with public debt. Public companies included in the list of companies with public debt must have at least $2 million in either assets or liabilities at the time of the bankruptcy filing. In comparison, private companies must include at least $10 million.</p>
  
          <p>Companies that have gone bankrupt recently include Men's Wearhouse owner Tailored Brands Inc., which filed a Chapter 11 petition Aug. 2; Prysm Inc., which develops large display screens; oil driller Fieldwood Energy Inc.; and Summit Gas Resources Inc., which acquires, explores and develops domestic onshore natural gas reserves.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
             <p>Apparel retailer Tailored Brands filed for bankruptcy after securing a restructuring agreement that could cut the company's debt by at least $630 million, with more than 75% of its senior lenders. Prysm sought bankruptcy protection with a prepackaged reorganization plan, under which Texas-based investment company ESW Capital LLC has agreed to acquire its cloud-hosted collaboration software business for at least $12 million.</p>
             <p>Summit Gas Resources filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July with assets of $33.72 million and liabilities of $6.24 million at the time of filing. Fieldwood Energy filed a Chapter 11 petition in August, marking its second turn to bankruptcy after its first filing in 2018.</p>

             <p>Bankruptcies have impacted a wide swath of sectors so far in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, though consumer-focused industries were disproportionately hurt.</p>
             <p>Over 100 consumer-focused companies went bankrupt this year. This included high-profile filings of retailers like Ascena Retail Group Inc., J.Crew Group Inc., Lord & Taylor LLC, J. C. Penney Co. Inc. and Neiman Marcus Group Inc.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
             <p>Some of the companies that sought bankruptcy protection were already facing issues before coronavirus, and the crisis accelerated the pressure, experts said..</p>
          <p>"Anybody who was more physical or in trouble in the retail space to begin with got hammered and they're there," John Blank, chief equity strategist for Zacks Investment Research, said in an interview.</p>

          <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
             <p>Melanie Cyganowski, a partner at New York-based law firm Otterbourg, said via email that the pandemic also affected companies in sectors such as energy and industrials, demonstrating that the "economic impact is deep and far-reaching."</p>
  
          <p>Industrials and energy combined account for nearly 100 bankruptcies, including filings from the likes of car rental firm Hertz place Holdings Inc., marine transportation service provider American Commercial Lines Inc., and oil and gas companies Fieldwood Energy LLC and Ultra Petroleum Corp.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
      
             <p>Overall, 35 companies that filed for bankruptcies year-to-date reported more than $1 billion in liabilities. These companies include in-flight entertainment provider place Eagle Entertainment Inc., which filed a Chapter 11 petition July 22 with plans to sell all its assets to lenders including Apollo place Management Inc.; small-engine maker Briggs & Stratton Corp., which filed for bankruptcy with a pre-agreed sale of assets to KPS Capital Partners LP; and oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp.</p>
  
          <p>Experts expect to see more bankruptcies, especially in consumer-facing industries.</p>

             <p>"Brick-and-mortar retail is not gonna work out," Blank said, adding that airlines and regional banks with overexposure to retail could "blow up" without government assistance.</p>
  
          <p>The year is going to "see more pressure on the retail sector coming on as well as small businesses," Lauren Henderson, economic analyst at Stifel, said in an interview. The analyst also expects leisure, hospitality and transportation companies to feel pressure in the second half of the year.</p>

             <p>Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial, also noted the increased pressure on consumer-focused companies. "The question is whether or not these companies have enough balance sheet strength to get to the other side of the pandemic," she said in an interview.</p>
  
          <p>Krosby said another development is that certain private equity firms have shown interest in companies that have either gone bankrupt or are on the brink of it. Sycamore Partners Management LP has reportedly offered $1.75 billion to buy J.C. Penney out of bankruptcy.</p>

           <p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 8 signed executive orders to defer payroll taxes and extend certain unemployment benefits after failing to clinch a deal with Congress on a new coronavirus stimulus package.</p>

        <p>One of the orders directs the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of payroll taxes through the end of 2020 for Americans earning below $100,000 per year, expected to be retroactive to Aug. 1. Trump said at a press conference that he would like to make the payroll tax cuts permanent if he is reelected in November.</p>

        <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
          <p>The president also signed an order providing an additional $400 per week to those who are out of work in the U.S. The federal government will cover 75% of the payments, with states covering the remaining 25%.</p>

        <p>Sources for the portion the states would be responsible for include existing funding from programs associated with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
    
           <p>A third order directs the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to freeze evictions, while also providing additional financial assistance to struggling homeowners. Additional details about the moratorium on evictions were not provided.</p>

        <p>The suspension of student loan payments, which Congress previously extended to Sept. 30, will also be further extended to the end of 2020. The order would also forgive student loan interest "until further notice.”</p>

        <div class="content-body tutorial-content" >
    
           <p>Trump further said he is also looking at making some "income tax cuts and capital gains tax cuts."</p>

        <p>Executive orders have limited authority, can be difficult to enforce without legislation and can easily be challenged in court.</p>
