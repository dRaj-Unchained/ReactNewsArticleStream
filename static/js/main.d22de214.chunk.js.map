To reach that level of impairment there would have to be a very slow recovery from the 2020 first half economic shock and a double-dip recession later in the year. Indeed, the cumulative loss of economic output would have to be around twice as large as the MPC's central projection, with unemployment reaching about 15%, for instance.</p>\r\n                   <p>The BoE estimates that the £120 billion of losses in the \"reverse stress test\" would deplete around 60% of the buffers of capital which sit above banks' minimum requirements.
